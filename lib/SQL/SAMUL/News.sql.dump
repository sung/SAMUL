GBrowse 2.0 is a rewrite of the original GBrowse to add dynamic updating via AJAX and a smoother user experience. In addition, it provides administrators with the ability to attach a different genome database to each GBrowse track, making it much easier to manage and update tracks. It also provides a distributed backend system of \"slave\" renderers, allowing each track to be rendered in parallel on a different machine and significantly increasing performance. GBrowse 2.0 is currently in alpha test, but is quite usable.

You will need Bio::Das version 1.17 and Bio::Graphics version 2.11 for best results.\r\nThe \"import track\" function now allows you to specify the URL of either a BAM or a BigWig file. The track will be displayed without physically copying the file onto the GBrowse server. You will need Bio::DB::Bam and Bio::DB::BigWig for these features to work.\r\nUploading a Wig file now generates a BigWig database for improved performance and scalability. This requires Bio::DB::BigWig to be installed.\r\nThere is now a \"Get chromosome sizes\" entry in the File menu.\r\nCalling GBrowse with the CGI argument \"action=scan\" will generate a quick summary of track contents.\r\nImproved performance when working with truly huge (>1000 track definition) configuration files.\r\nFasta, GFF3, SAM and wiggle dumps now include the genome build ID if that information is provided in the data source \"metadata\" configuration variable.','messenger/news/16');
